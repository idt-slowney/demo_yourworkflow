Using an excessive number of cores has a diminishing return! It is recommended not to exceed 8 cores per trimming process (you asked for 8 cores). Please consider re-specifying

Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 3.4
Could not detect version of Python used by Cutadapt from the first line of Cutadapt (but found this: >>>#!/bin/sh<<<)
Letting the (modified) Cutadapt deal with the Python version instead
Parallel gzip (pigz) detected. Proceeding with multicore (de)compression using 8 cores

AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> test_sample1_1.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	5000	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	5000	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	5000	0.00
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count Illumina: 0, count smallRNA: 0, count Nextera: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).
